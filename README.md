Pomodoro Timer Application 

This is a simple Pomodoro Timer application created using Python's tkinter library. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It involves breaking work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, known as "Pomodoros," followed by short breaks.


Features
Customizable work time, short break time, and long break time.

Visual cues for different timer phases (work, short break, long break).

Keeps track of completed Pomodoros with checkmarks.


Prerequisites

Python 3.x

tkinter library (usually included with Python installations)

Customization


You can customize the duration of work intervals and breaks by modifying the following constants in the code:
